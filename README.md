timebomb: C++ header for implementing compile time asserts based on __date.
=========================================================================

This header-only "library" provides utility functions that can be used to write
static assertions that trigger on a particular __DATE____. This might be useful
when planning a future deprecation of an API.  This requires c++20 or later.

Usage
-----
See test.cc and example.hh
